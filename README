What is the process for building and deploying?

1) Make your changes to the project

2) Test your changes using a local webserver
   - build Gemfile.lock using `bundle --without production`
   - create the database `rake db:migrate`
   - use `rails server`
     	 -This runs a local instance;viewable at 127.0.0.1:3000

2) git commit -m "Message stating what I did to the project"
   -use `git status` to confirm that all your files are added before commiting
   -remember, commit makes local changes only, you must still git push

3) To push changes to github repo
   - use `git push origin master`




What if I changed GemFile?
     You now need to push changes Gemfile and also create a new Gemfile.lock
     by using `bundle update`.
